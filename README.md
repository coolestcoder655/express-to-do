# Express + React To-Do App

This repository contains a simple To-Do application built using Express.js for the backend and React with TypeScript for the frontend. It demonstrates my learning journey with modern web development technologies, including React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Express.

## Features

- **Backend**: Built with Express.js to manage API endpoints and server functionalities.
- **Frontend**: Developed with React and TypeScript for a dynamic and type-safe UI.
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for quick and responsive design.
- **State Management**: Uses React's Context API for managing application state.
- **Database**: TBD (Can be extended with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or any preferred database).
